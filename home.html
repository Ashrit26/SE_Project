  <div class="center"><b>Sports at NITK</b></div></div>
  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Did you think that NITK is just a temple of nerds and extracurricular activities like sports and games are not given any kind of attention then think again.<br><br>NITK offers state of the art sports facilities.&nbsp; The college sports an Olympic size swimming pool, three tennis courts, two basketball courts, two volleyball courts, full size football and cricket grounds, one hockey field, one handball court, three badminton courts, five T.T tables etc. Other games like Chess and Carrom are also encouraged.<br><br><em><u><font size="5"><font color="brown">Swimming Pool:</font></font></u></em><br>All students are welcome to register and utilize the facility. But being in a proper&nbsp;swimming attire is a must i.e. swimming costume/trunks + cap. Instructor and life guards are always&nbsp;present. But the registration process is a bit of a pain; the student has to submit a Xerox copy of his/her admission letter in order to get the registration form.&nbsp;<br><br>Then he/she has to get an approval from a&nbsp;doctor in Health Care Centre saying that he/she is fit for swimming. Swimming wear can be brought by&nbsp;the student or it can also be bought in the store inside the swimming pool. Advice: Maximize its use in&nbsp;summer.<br><br><em><u><font size="5"><font color="#brown">Football:&nbsp;</font></font></u></em><br>Football is very popular in NITK. Every evening one can find at least 6-8 groups playing football&nbsp;in the ground apart from the college team. Footballs and practice cones can be issued from the sports&nbsp;complex adjacent to the ground by giving your college ID (or Library card). Again Inter collegiate and&nbsp;Inter year tournaments are held. Also there is a special “only freshers” tournament held in the beginning&nbsp;of 1st&nbsp;semester between the twelve 1st year classes. Five a side Beach football is organized during&nbsp;Incident and five a side ‘flood lit’ football tournament is held during Phoenix.<br><br>&nbsp;Inter NIT tournament was&nbsp;held last year and NITK won the Gold medal. Want to get into the college team? Just practice with the&nbsp;<br>team every evening. Selections will be held in the 1st semester.<br><br>P.S. The NITK football team is awesome.<br><br><font size="5"><u><em><font color="brown">Basketball:</font></em></u></font><br><br>Basketball: There are two basketball courts. Both of them are in a great condition. One of them is&nbsp;reserved for the college team and should be vacated whenever they come for practice. The other one&nbsp;<br>can be made use of at any time. There are two major competitions that take place on these courts,&nbsp;one is the inter collegiate basketball tournament known as the “Slam dunk” which takes place during&nbsp;<br>Incident, and the other one is the inter year basketball tournament which takes place during crescendo.&nbsp;<br><br>Inter class freshers tournament is held in the 1st&nbsp;and want to get into the college team just join the team in practice every evening. Selections will be&nbsp;held.<br><br>P.S The Basketball team is pretty awesome too.<br><br><em><u><font size="5"><font color="brown">Cricket:</font></font></u></em><br><br>Cricket too is very popular in NITK. Cricket bats, balls, stumps etc. can be issued from the&nbsp;complex by giving your college ID. Inter Year and Inter branch tournaments are held. Last year the inter&nbsp;class “mixed” cricket tournament was organized (5 boys + 2 girls required in one team :P). Selections for&nbsp;getting into the College cricket team will be held in either the 1st&nbsp;or 2nd&nbsp;semester.<br><br><em><u><font size="5"><font color="brown">Badminton/Table Tennis:</font></font></u></em><br>The courts and tables are located inside the sports complex. The complex is&nbsp;open from 6 in the morning to 8 in the evening. One can issue T.T balls and Shuttles from the complex.&nbsp;<br><br>But one has to bring their own T.T bats and Badminton racquets too play. Inter class badminton and T.T&nbsp;tournament is held at the beginning of 1st&nbsp;semester for the freshers by the Recreational committee.<br><br></div>
